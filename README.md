decode, encode convert base64

Base64 is a collective name for a number of related binary-to-text encoding techniques that convert binary data into an ASCII string format known as radix-64. A particular MIME content transfer encoding is where the phrase Base64 first appeared.

When it comes to encoding binary data for storage and transmission via ASCII-compatible media, Base64 encoding techniques are often utilized. This is done to make sure that the data gets transported without being altered. Base64 is often utilized in a variety of applications, including MIME-enabled email and the storage of complicated data in XML.

Different implementations use a different set of 64 characters to represent the 64 digit values for the base. The typical approach is to select 64 printable characters that are similar to most encodings. This combination makes it difficult for the data to be altered while being transmitted across 8-bit-unclean information channels like email.Â For the first 62 values, A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 are used in MIME's Base64 implementation. Other versions, such as UTF-7, also have this feature but have other choices for the last two values.
